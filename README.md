# Distributed Architecture Student Project

This folder contains two rust related applications:
 1. `server/` contains a rust server based on rocket which has a simple API (see below).
 2. `client/` contains a node application which uses a rust based wasm.

## Server and Client configuration

### Domains and ports

Server is running on `http://localhost:8000/` and client is running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Server API

 * ping_endpoint

Computes the average response time to the provided `domain`. Number of sampling iterations is provided via the `iterations` body member.

```rust
#[post("/ping", format="application/x-www-form-urlencoded", data = "<user_input>")]
pub fn ping_endpoint(user_input: Form<PingRequest>) -> Json<PingResponse>

// Body:
pub struct PingRequest {
    domain: String,
    iterations: i64,
}
```
